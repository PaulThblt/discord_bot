# Discord Music Bot
## Setup
Clone the repository, then install all the dependencies with ***`npm install`***

Then you need to create a **`config.json`** file in which you are going to put the prefix you want to invoke your bot to and your discord bot token :
```
{
  "prefix": "!",
  "token": YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
}
```
>Note: to create a discord bot token, go to https://discord.com/developers/applications

## Usage
Invite your bot in a selected server using the *Discord Dev* interface, then connect to a channel and start using the bot with the prefix you selected during the setup!

>For example here: 
`!play https://youtu.be/nFk20L7MrDw`
